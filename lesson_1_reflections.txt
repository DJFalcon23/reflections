How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	I was able to the lines side-by-side, which helped me find the error.
 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	I could look at my mistakes and learn from theme,or look at code that I forgot I took out.

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	I would have more control over how many versions there are, by using Git. I wouldn't have that control if I used Google Docs.

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google 
Docs, treat each file separately?
	The reason may be do to the fact that Git is designed to be used with files of code, and Google isn't.

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	The 'git log' command shows an overview of the past commits, the command 'git diff' shows the differences of those commits.
 
 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	I can always go back to a correctly working version.

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?	
  	To host and check my code.
